### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 My background is clinical medicine (Pediatrics). I’m currently a doctoral student in Clinical Epidemiology at [Krefting Research Centre in University of Gothenburg](https://www.gu.se/en/krefting-research) (Sweden). I am working on female sex hormones and women's health (with a particular focus on asthma), using epidemiological methods as well as evidence synthesis tools (including systematic review, meta-analysis, and umbrella review). I am passionate about Open Science and research reproducibility.
- 🌱 I’m learning causal inference using observational data, and applying both Frequentist & Bayesian statistics.
- 🤔 I’m looking for a research position (e.g., postdoc) in Clinical Epidemiology.
- :cowboy_hat_face: Fun fact about me: work like a robot, play like a kid.
